# Machine learning - Image classification

Today we want to look at different image classification methods with 2 different datasets, MNIST and Fashion MNIST.

### Datasets 

As mentioned in the previous section, we will be performing our test and evaluation on the two MNIST dataset. One is the handwritten digit MNIST and the other is the Fashion MNIST dataset, both dataset has the similar attributes where both datasets contains sets of 28 x 28 greyscale image label under 10 classes.
